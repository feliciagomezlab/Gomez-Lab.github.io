Our Lab brings together specialists in medical, data-driven, genetic research to investigate the genetic factors driving Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Our work focuses on understanding how somatic mutations influence disease characteristics and treatment responses. Despite the challenges posed by the rarity of malignant Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), we employ ultra-deep exome-wide sequencing and specialized analysis techniques to identify these mutations and explore their association with clinical outcomes. Our mission is to push the boundaries of cancer research, integrating advanced genomic profiling and bioinformatics to inform and improve oncology practices.
